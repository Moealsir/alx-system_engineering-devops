# Postmortem: When the Web Application Server Took a Siesta

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** May 10, 2024, 2:00 PM - May 10, 2024, 4:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Picture this: our beloved web application server decided to take an impromptu siesta, leaving users stranded in the digital wilderness. Approximately 50% of users experienced the frustration of slow response times or downright rejection from the server's slumber.
- **Root Cause:** Turns out, our server had a case of Mondayitis and succumbed to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to one poor server instance bearing the brunt of the workload.

## Timeline

- **Detection:** May 10, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)
  - The incident jolted us awake when monitoring alerts rudely interrupted our peaceful coding flow, screaming about increased response times and error rates.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Bleary-eyed engineers stumbled into action, sifting through server logs and network traffic in a desperate attempt to uncover the root cause.
  - Initially, we blamed it on the coffee shortage-induced database migrations, but reality hit harder than a Monday morning alarm clock when we realized only one server instance was sweating bullets.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - In our drowsy state, we briefly entertained the idea of a caffeine-deprived DDoS attack, but even our sleep-deprived brains knew that was a stretch.
- **Escalation:**
  - As the situation worsened, we sounded the alarm (literally) and summoned the DevOps team to help us slap some sense into the load balancer.
- **Resolution:**
  - With caffeine-infused determination, we pinpointed and corrected the misconfigured load balancer settings, spreading the workload love evenly across all server instances.
  - Peace was restored to the digital realm as we rolled back the load balancer changes, bidding adieu to our server's siesta.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause:**
  - Our server's Mondayitis-induced misconfiguration in the load balancer led to an uneven distribution of workload, overwhelming one poor server instance.
- **Resolution:**
  - We banished the misconfigured load balancer settings to the shadow realm and implemented measures to ensure workload equality among server instances.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Instituting automated testing for load balancer configurations to prevent future Mondayitis-induced mishaps.
  - Enhancing our monitoring tools to keep a watchful eye on server performance and workload distribution.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Develop automated tests to validate load balancer configurations before deployment.
  2. Conduct a thorough review of load balancer settings to eliminate any potential misconfigurations.
  3. Beef up monitoring capabilities to include alerts for load balancer health and workload distribution.
  4. Schedule regular load testing sessions to keep our servers on their toes.

## Conclusion

In the grand saga of server mishaps, this was but a brief interlude of chaos swiftly quelled by the heroic efforts of our intrepid team. As we bid farewell to our server's unexpected siesta, we emerge stronger and wiser, armed with the knowledge to fend off future Mondayitis-induced disasters. Let us march forward with vigilance, for the digital wilderness is a treacherous realm, but with coffee in hand and wit in our hearts, we shall prevail!
